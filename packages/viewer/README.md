# viewer

The frontend application for the embedding atlas.

Build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will serve Embedding Atlas UI at http://localhost:5173. Note that the UI requires a backend server to provide data to it. You can start one via the `./start.sh` mentioned above. Without a backend server, you can still go to http://localhost:5173/#/test to view a test dataset.
